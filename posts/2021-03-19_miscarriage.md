Today marks the last day of winter and officially 2 months since I found out I was miscarrying my first pregnancy. Somehow the two seem to coincide... but as spring approaches and the flowers poke from the ground I look forward to a new chapter starting. Admittedly a chapter that I have no idea the plot of but I am certain there are brighter days ahead.

This is something I never expected to go through let alone post about but when our first pregnancy ended in miscarriage, I found so much comfort in the stories of those who had experienced a similar loss. For that reason, I too will share our story and maybe it will give someone even just a little comfort that they are not alone.

So here it goes…

I found out I was expecting on December 15, 2020 and shared the news with my husband on December 17, 2020. We were over the moon excited. It felt like it was meant to be. The timing seemed to represent the circle of life as we had just lost my husband’s Gram earlier in the month. It also would have worked out perfectly with work dates. Not to mention I would have been on maternity leave with essentially all my besties.

I overanalyzed if my pregnancy symptoms were strong enough. I did not have a lot of nausea or fatigue but would randomly throw up and oddly found comfort in those moments.

I knew that at least 1 in 4 pregnancies end in loss and tried to prepare myself for any outcome.

But nothing truly prepared me for January 20th, 2021. We went into our first ultrasound appointment a little anxious but mostly excited to meet our little human.

The ultrasound tech took a while to find the baby and didn’t say a lot. I asked her how big our baby was measuring and she said 6 weeks 4 days with a heartbeat of 108. I knew something wasn’t right, I was supposed to be 9 weeks 1 day. I made it to the car before bursting into tears. My husband told me not to worry, the midwife called and said the same. I scoured the internet for answers and didn’t find any. Everyone’s story seemed so unique.

Two days later I went for bloodwork and my HCG was nice and high and I felt flickers of hope. On Monday, I went back for more blood testing, hoping to see the number rise further. I checked My Ehealth all day waiting for the reassurance I so desperately wanted but when I checked for the 100th time that day in the driveway mid-afternoon I instead saw that the number had dropped and I knew we were losing our first baby.

That is how I saw it, I not only lost a pregnancy, but I also lost a baby that I had dreamed of meeting and watching them grow. I had planned our first Christmas card. We had bought a bassinette and a crib.

I went on Thursday to the women’s clinic where I met a new Doctor who did another ultrasound and confirmed that our baby had not grown any further and no longer had a heartbeat. She advised that I could take medication that had a 95% success rate or I could do a D&C.

I chose to take the medication as I could start the process right away and could avoid the hospital during the pandemic.

I took the first medication that night and then the second medication on Saturday. Saturday was awful. I threw up for 11 hours straight, had a fever, heavy bleeding, and almost unbearable cramps but I made it through and the next day my nausea was gone. I thought I was ready for my body to start healing and to move into the next phase but a week later I was still having bleeding. I was booked in for another ultrasound.

I was told at this ultrasound that I had retained tissue and either needed to go on Birth Control for a period of time or get a D&C. I chose the D&C immediately. I could not have this continue to drag on. I went to the car where my husband was waiting to celebrate a Valentine’s afternoon. I was angry and sad and cried all the way to our spa date. My husband was of course amazingly supportive as he has been this entire journey.

On Wednesday I went into the hospital on my own as my husband was not allowed in due to the pandemic. I was asked to change into a hospital gown and was put on a stretcher. Over the next 2.5 hours, I would be wheeled around to different locations and asked different questions until it was my turn to go into the operating room. A young guy did my IV and screwed it up but eventually got it. I felt really strong until my turn came and I teared up. It felt so final and was scary. The team was really good. One of the nurses, Bonnie, rubbed my shoulder and told me I had beautiful eyelashes and said where did you get those from? that is the last thing I remember before waking up in a different room, still crying. I missed the idea of being pregnant and having my sweet baby so much.

This process was physically challenging but I do believe my body is healing as it should now but it is hard to know with any certainty.

Of course, the process was also emotionally challenging. One of the hardest parts for me was that this experience was so out of my control. I have tried to calculate when I will get pregnant again and reassure myself that I won’t fall too far behind my friends who are having their little ones but this is an impossible task. So, I control what I can, I limit my coffee and alcohol, etc, and just try to be as healthy as possible. I want to be both physically and mentally healthy so I also reached out to a counselor who specializes in fertility issues. She couldn’t fit me in for 5 weeks but it was well worth the wait. In that 5 week waiting period, I read the baby loss guide by Zoe Clark-Coates that includes a 60 day guided journal. I highly recommend this book for anyone experiencing a loss.

One of my close friends actually sent me some books after my loss and it was such a thoughtful gift. I was so lucky to have so many supportive people in our life as we went through this. Other thoughtful gestures were:

- calls or texts to just say hello or say they were there to talk or go for a walk if needed
- dropping off comfort food for recovery days
- suggesting activities to do together to take my mind off things.

I know supporting our loved ones through loss can be hard so I hope sharing these gestures may help you help someone close to you in the future. I have learned a lot about how I want to support others moving forward.

Ultimately, I have to trust that the universe has a plan and that this is all part of it. I know we will be parents to beautiful babies that make it to our arms one day and we will be patient with the journey to get there or at least try to be.

I have found that being really open with others about my experience has been really healing for me. I appreciate the others that have been open in return, these stories give me strength.

As much as I wish no one ever had to go through this, this is my story and I want to remember this journey even though it’s been hard because I want to remember our baby, who we call Ember, and acknowledge how they impacted our lives and shaped who we are moving forward.

I hope our babies never have to lose their babies but if they do I want them to have the option to know Ember’s story and that our experience was hard but that we went on to be okay.

I have to trust that this process is unfolding perfectly even if it doesn’t always feel that way.
